#### *A story about internet equality*

   How does the global digital gender gap contribute to the underrepresentation of women in computer science, and what is being done to close it?

   Despite the contributions to technology made by individuals like Ada Lovelace, Annie Easely, and Margaret Hamilton, women have been notoriously underrepresented in STEM spaces. An analysis performed by the Department of Labor ([DoL](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/data/occupations-stem)) indicates a 4% decrease in the percentage of women in computer science careers over the last decade — and a staggering 10% decrease since the 1990s, a period that first saw the introduction of women-centric computing events like the Grace Hopper Celebration.  
   There are many possible explanations as to why there’s been a steady decline in workforce representation: unsupportive career environments, social stigma, and X can all discourage women from pursuing a role in computer science. But there is one more – often overlooked – barrier that exists long before a girl or woman ever enters a classroom or applies for a job: *access to the internet itself*.
   
   Despite being engineered for global interconnectivity, the internet remains inaccessible to major portions of the population. This is best quantified by the Economist’s [Inclusive Internet Index](https://impact.economist.com/projects/inclusive-internet-index/), studied annually since 2017\. It serves as a valuable tool to define digital accessibility: in America alone, a (seemingly) small 1% difference in online presence between genders represents approximately 3.3 million women.  
   To measure this difference (among others) the Inclusive Internet Index calculates data based on four key metrics: accessibility, affordability, relevance, and readiness.   
   While affordability is relatively self-explanatory, the other metrics gauge more complex barriers:  
      Accessibility measures the available infrastructure present,   
      Relevance centers the amount of information available in an area (and in that area’s language)  
      Readiness assesses a populations’ skills and ability to use the internet effectively.

   The map reveals some critical information about the state of gender disparities worldwide — the gap is severe in financially insecure and developing nations (who are struggling to meet metrics such as relevance and affordability on a whole), but what is interesting is the way it persists even into wealthier countries.   
   It’s important to recognize that the gap does not exclusively measure one aspect or function of the internet — this isn’t a disparity across social media or within computer science fields. This is a fundamental divide that prohibits women from entering the tech economy by failing to equip them with the necessary tools, effectively stunting their digital literacy.

   Digital literacy — defined as the ability to find, evaluate, and [communicate information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy) using digital media — is a skillset that women are prevented from acquiring due to this gap. Without repeated, sustained and early access to the internet, women lose out on crucial time to learn about the foundational skills that build a career in technology.  
Addressing the divide comes from providing an adequate toolset for women to utilize: e-inclusivity policies and programs are gaining traction globally. They come in the form of women-centric summits, education-based ordinances, and better policy — and their effect is undeniable.

   The World Bank Group addresses affordability and accessibility for women by helping to address infrastructure shortages and provide more cost-sustainable technology — effectively eliminating a major challenge that prevents women from ever interacting with the devices and programs that could help them learn.  
   Women in Internet Governance seeks to cover relevance and readiness by providing education tailored to the communities they’re working with, helping women to build the skills and readiness for engaging with the internet. It isn’t enough to just provide people with a computer or handheld, they need support to use them effectively. This is achieved through not only non-profits like WIG, but by local and even national policies centering on education initiatives.  
   Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan is one initiative that sought to elevate the literacy of rural communities in India, focusing on building such skills as communications and applications of the internet — where women comprised over [53](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2080854)% of the enrolled participants.

   Implementing these solutions has proven difficult, and the recorded progress is non-linear. But by creating effective spaces by and for women, and passing policies that center digital development, a greater balance can be achieved. The specific focus on measuring the divide through frameworks like the Inclusive Internet Index provides a clear path towards targeted interventions that can better guide women into STEM.
