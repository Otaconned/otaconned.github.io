## What I'm About . . .
I am a **strong** proponent for the use of technology as a tool to uplift healthcare and improve educational resources. I also believe strongly in the importance of visible queerness in STEM programs, and my projects tend to reflect a bias toward the subject matter. 

## What I Can Do . . . 
I can confidently write programs in 
- Java (including frameworks such as Spring/Boot
- SQL
- Assembly 
With a more novice understanding of
- R/Python
- PowerBI
- Tableau
